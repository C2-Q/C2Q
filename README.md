# How to contribute

## Getting started

- Fork the repository on GitHub
- Read the [README.md](./README.md) for build instructions

## Reporting bugs and creating issues

Reporting bugs is one of the best ways to contribute. 

## Contribution flow

This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

- Create a topic branch from where to base the contribution. This is usually main.
- Then everytime you start working, before pushing your branchâ€™s changes to the main branch, it's good to update your branch with the latest changes from main to avoid conflicts:
```rb
# Fetch the latest updates from the remote repository:
git fetch origin
# Checkout your branch (replace `your-branch` with the branch name)
git checkout your-branch
# Merge or rebase the latest changes from the main branch into your branch
git merge origin/main
```
- Make commits of logical units.
- Make sure commit messages are in the proper format (see below).
- Push changes in a topic branch to a personal fork of the repository.
- Submit a pull request to gojue/ecapture.
